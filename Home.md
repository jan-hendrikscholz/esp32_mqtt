# Welcome to the esp32_mqtt_eq3 wiki!

This project was established to allow use of esp32 devices as BLE bridges for eq-3 valves. As BLE range is limited multiple esp32 devices can be used to allow central control of many distributed eq-3 valves via mqtt.
This means that eq-3 valves can be controlled from home-automation software (e.g. openhab) or via bespoke heating control applications.
